Workflow
 Tic Tac Toe Game – How It Works
1.	The game starts, and it's Player X's turn.
2.	A player clicks on a box to make their move.
3.	If the box is empty, the game:
o	Puts the player's symbol (X or 0) in the box.
o	Switches the turn to the other player.
o	Updates the message to show whose turn it is now.
o	Then checks if there's a winner.
4.	While checking for a win:
o	The game looks at all the possible ways someone can win (rows, columns, and diagonals).
o	If all three boxes in any winning line have the same symbol, that player wins.
o	The game shows a message like “X Won” or “0 Won”.
o	All boxes are then locked, so no more moves can be made.
o	A line is drawn across the winning combination.
